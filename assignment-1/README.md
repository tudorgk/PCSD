Assignment 1
============

This assignment targets the following learning goals:
- Discuss the design of a top-level abstraction in terms of lower level ab- stractions and naming. Explain strategies employed for correctness, per- formance, and fault tolerance.
- Identify and explain techniques for improving performance in computer systems.
- Implement functionality in a client-service design providing for strong modularity with an RPC mechanism based on an HTTP transport.
- Reflect on characteristics of such a client-service design, including per- formance and fault-tolerance as well as how strong modularity allows for applying performance improvements in a way that is transparent to clients.
