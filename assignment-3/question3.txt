According to the theory, a performance metric is considered reliable if a system A outperforms a system B when the corresponding values of the metric for both systems indicate that system A should outperform system B. \\

Based on the graphs we can safely infer that latency is a reliable metric as we can see that as we increase the number of concurrent clients, the lantecy does too. As for for the throughput we cannot say that it is a reliable metric. As we can see from the graphs there relation between the number of clients and throuphput even after configuring the workload metrics. \\

An additional metric that could be used to demonstrate the performance of the book-store is the Execution time. Since it can give precise results concerning the time it took for the system to execute a given program or a unit test. This way, as the theory says, we can compare time directly, or use them to derive appropriate rates. \\

Another metric that could be used the Speedup. Although, it is defined in terms of throughput, it is often calculated directly from execution times. As a result, we can safely say that it is a reliable metric for our system. \\
